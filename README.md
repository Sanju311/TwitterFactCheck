# Insight.ai - Twitter Fact-Checker
Fact-Check tweets instantly with Insight

## Introduction
Insight is a chrome extension that allows users to fact-check tweets in real-time. The extension has an easy-to-use interface. A fact-check button is rendered when a user interacts with a tweet, and clicking the button fact-checks the tweet content using the <strong>OpenAI GPT-3.5 API.</strong>

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- Chrome Extension Tools
- GPT 3.5
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI

## Features
The tool categorizes the tweet into 1 of three categories
- True
- False
- Unverifiable
There are plans to add more nuanced categories, and to support tweets with images with the release of GPT-4.
